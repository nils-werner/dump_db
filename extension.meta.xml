	<releases>
		<release version="1.09" date="2011-12-13" min="2.2">
			Search Index compatibility.
			Due to the potentially huge size in search index indexes their data isn't being saved. Dumps will contain only their structure but not their content.
			Note that after importing a dump all your indexes will be gone so you'll have to re-index them.
		</release>
		<release version="1.08" date="2011-02-02" min="2.2">
			Symphony 2.2 compatibility.
			Removed hash and date from filename. Hash isn't needed as `.sql` files are now protected by `.htaccess` and date can be injected in the filename without the need for sprintf.
		</release>
		<release version="1.07" date="2010-12-10" min="2.0.7">
			Extension will now show a notification on every backend page if one of the dump files is newer than your database.
			Also, it will show a notification and disable the "Dump"-buttons if one of the files isn't writeable.
